# Hangman Game

A simple terminal-based Hangman game written in Python. The player tries to guess a randomly selected word, one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess reduces the number of lives. The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or all lives are lost.


## Project Structure

hangman.py â€“ main game logic,

hangman_words.py â€“ word bank used for random selection,

hangman_shape.py â€“ ASCII visuals for lives and logo.
